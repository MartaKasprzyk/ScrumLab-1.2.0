# ScrumLab-1.2.0

This repository was prepared during Python Developer course at CodersLab. ScrumLab is a project with a goal to learn how to work in a team of programmers. It simulates real tasks in a web application project. We have been participating in daily meetings, solving problems, doing code reviews and integrating our code with colleagues' code.

Basic html (without python inserts) templates and static files were pre-configured, the role of our team was to prepare the backend for this application and make sure it works as expected. All functionalities were provided with the project brief. 

# About the application: 

Ms. Maria Iksińska wrote a cookbook that became a bestseller on the cookbook market in Poland and asked us to prepare a meal planning application for its readers.
